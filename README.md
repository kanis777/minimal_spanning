A minimal spanning tree is a subgraph of a weighted, connected graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. It represents the most cost-effective way to connect all nodes in a network while avoiding redundant connections and minimizing the overall cost

In today's interconnected world, networks play a major role in various domains. Optimizing these networks is crucial to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. One fundamental problem in network optimization is finding the minimal spanning tree (MST) of a given graph.
